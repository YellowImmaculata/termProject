      <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
      <p>I have an educational background in global politics, particularly in the region of Central Europe and the subjects of intelligence and national security.  I have interned for the Department of State during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I want to help preserve American ideals and make the world a better place!</p>
      <h2>Family First</h2>
      <p>I have always wanted to start a family, and I expect that I will have done so by 2025!</p>
